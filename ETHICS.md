# Ethical Considerations for Web Scraping

## Overview

Web scraping can be a useful tool for gathering and organizing data, but it comes with ethical responsibilities. This project scrapes travel destination data from **Rough Guides** and uses the **Open Library Search API** to find related books. Below are the ethical considerations I followed, including responsible data collection, adherence to website policies, and privacy protection.

## Purpose of Data Collection

The goal of this project is to gather publicly available information about travel destinations from Rough Guides and recommend related books through the Open Library Search API. The data includes:

- **Destination Name**: The country or city name.
- **Destination URL**: The link to the Rough Guides destination page.
- **Book Title, Author, and Publication Year**: Information about books related to the destination.

This data helps travelers and readers find books to learn more about places they may visit. The project does not collect any private information or disrupt the host websites.

## Data Sources and Compliance

### Data Sources

- **Rough Guides**: For destination names and URLs.
- **Open Library Search API**: To find relevant books for each destination.

### Website Compliance

- **robots.txt Compliance**: Before scraping Rough Guides, I checked their robots.txt file to ensure that my scraping complies with their guidelines. I avoided restricted areas as per their terms of service.
- **Non-Intrusive Scraping**: I only collected publicly available destination data and avoided any content behind paywalls or requiring login access.

## Responsible Scraping Practices

- **Rate Limiting**: To avoid overloading the website, I implemented delays between requests.
- **Respecting Privacy**: No personal user data or sensitive information is collected.
- **API Usage**: I used the Open Library API to retrieve public book information related to the destination names.

## Data Handling

- **Data Collected**: Only public data from Rough Guides and Open Library, such as destination names, URLs, book titles, authors, and publication years.
- **No Personal Information**: I did not collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII), ensuring full compliance with privacy best practices.

This document outlines the ethical steps I followed to ensure responsible and non-intrusive data collection, respectful of both the websites' terms and privacy considerations.
